# How it works?

A user first creates a group, inviting people that they want in the group. 

Then, once the group is formed, any member of the group can create meetings within the group during which the member has to input the length of the meeting and a date range that the meeting has to happen between. The member can also select which group members will be part of the meeting. 

Once a meeting is created, all included members except for the creator has to upload a schedule of their availability. 

At any point, the creator of the meeting can see who has/hasn't uploaded yet and also generate possible meeting slots from the uploaded schedules from which they can choose the final meeting slot.
